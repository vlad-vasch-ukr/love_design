                        My name is Vlad Musienko, I’m a web designer.
                        I love to draw and all that is connected with the design.
                        In this area a long time ago and during this time I managed to create several
                        successful projects used by people all over the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I love the simplicity in the design of web sites. As I see it,people, it’s like my work. Naturally do not want to rest on our laurels and will continue further studies to improve soybean skills, creating new interesting creative projects.
